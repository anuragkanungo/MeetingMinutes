### Meeting Minutes:

1.	The application should be able to collect the following data:
a.	Project name
b.	Issue number
c.	Number of developers
d.	Commit messages
2.	It will be good to have a visualization component, but it is not a must-have requirement. 
3.	In next two to three it will be nice to have some kind of virtual development environment up and running, perhaps using Vagrant, which can display a simple “Hello World” message on the registered website.
4.	We would require a database to store data from tools like Jenkins, JIRA, etc. Thus, while developing architecture, we should also consider database schema. 
5.	The application should be extensible and flexible enough to allow other developers to be able to integrate other tools with our application without requiring to update core application layer. 
6.	We also need to ensure that when a user creates a new project, the application should for a case number or some unique project definition, which will be used to integrate all plugins. 
7.	The client suggested Plugin Architecture as one of the ways to design the system. Basically, between our application server and the tool, there should be a plugin layer, which will be responsible for passing information between the tool and the application server.  For reference, look at Hubot. 
8.	The team should start thinking about hosting environment and strategy for the application – either a ready box or download code and then deploy it to their environment using Vagrant/Docker, etc.
9.	The application should be platform neutral. 
10.	Next Wednesday we will have our first Sprint planning meeting. (Need to come up with deliverables for next two weeks)
11.	Decide on technology by Feb 15.


### Outcomes
1.	Use Github for task assignment.
2.	Create separate repositories for documentation in MarkDown, design code.
3.	Use Slack for communication.
4.	Use the Fork model for configuration management.
5.	Everyone has OSX on which the development will be done.
6.	Deployment environment would be Apache (preferred) or nginx/tomcat server.
7.	Prefer database that support Machine Learning. (Redis preferred)


### Project Goals
1.	Today, we have a handful of applications that can monitor system’s health, but applications that can monitor developer’s health are not that common. 
2.	The customer is interested in an application that can track development activities, team member’s bandwidth, and resource allocation across projects in real-time. 

### Reasons for Project Goals:
1. Developers gets overload, PM doesn’t have visibility how much the person is loaded. By having team visibility peers can help each other.
2. If a PM puts one dev on a project then how it will impact the other project for which the current developer is responsible.
3. Estimation and commiting a timeframe is challenge in an organization where developers work on multiple projects simultaneously.


### Action Items
| Item                                               | Responsible | Completed   |
|----------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|
| Share project description and goals                |             |   []        |
| Share screen designs and write up                  |             |  []         |
| Share website URL and CPanel Access               |             |   [x]       |
| Send recurring meeting invite                          |             |   [x]       |
| Create separate GitHub repositories for artifacts                                    |             |   [x]       |
| Send XiaoBao github email id  Xiao Bao                          |             |   [x]       |
| Add Xiao Bao to Github                    |             |   [x]       |
| Setup Slack and add everyone                          |             |   [x]       |
| Deep dive in data and find what data is important to be displayed                          |             |   [x]       |



### Action item to decide and dates
1. Jenkins CI on AWS
2. Look for creating deployment in Vagrantfile or as a docker container. Including security measures such that open architecture but all credentials are on local machine in plugin file.
3. How to merge data? may be grouping of projects.
4. Out of Scope of development during practicum but architecture should focus on being flexible enough that users can use their own visualization component. Later the system can tie to financial systems for Estimation, measurement of development data. (Insights/ Analytics using ML)

### Questions:
Does platform has to be mobile optimized?
