Meeting Minutes:

1.	The application should be able to collect the following data:
a.	Project name
b.	Issue number
c.	Number of developers
d.	Commit messages
2.	It will be good to have a visualization component, but it is not a must-have requirement. 
3.	In next two to three it will be nice to have some kind of virtual development environment up and running, perhaps using Vagrant, which can display a simple “Hello World” message on the registered website.
4.	We would require a database to store data from tools like Jenkins, JIRA, etc. Thus, while developing architecture, we should also consider database schema. 
5.	The application should be extensible and flexible enough to allow other developers to be able to integrate other tools with our application without requiring to update core application layer. 
6.	We also need to ensure that when a user creates a new project, the application should for a case number or some unique project definition, which will be used to integrate all plugins. 
7.	The client suggested Plugin Architecture as one of the ways to design the system. Basically, between our application server and the tool, there should be a plugin layer, which will be responsible for passing information between the tool and the application server.  For reference, look at Hubot. 
8.	The team should start thinking about hosting environment and strategy for the application – either a ready box or download code and then deploy it to their environment using Vagrant/Docker, etc.
9.	The application should be platform neutral. 
10.	Next Wednesday we will have our first Sprint planning meeting. (Need to come up with deliverables for next two weeks)
11.	Decide on technology by Feb 15.
